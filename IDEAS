Tab groups (folders)

- Create group
- Click and drag tab into group
- Right click to close entire group
- While in a tab that is in a group creating new tab, or new tab creating by clicking a link will auto add to that group.

Tab right click menu should mirror right click menu for tabs in default Firefox.

Tab syncing? - Would be cool to mirror from desktop to mobile and back

Need better close icon

Bookmarks should have full folder structure functionality
